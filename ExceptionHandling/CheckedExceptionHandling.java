/*What is an Exception?
An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
It occurs during runtime (e.g., dividing by zero, accessing invalid array index, etc.).

1. Checked Exceptions
	-Checked at compile-time.
	-Must be either caught using try-catch or declared using throws.
	-Usually related to external resources (files, database, network).

Examples:
IOException
SQLException
FileNotFoundException

<For Unchecked Exception please goto UncheckedException.java class>

Basic Syntax: try and catch block

try {
    // risky code
} catch (ExceptionType name) {
    // handle the exception
}

/*
i.try block:
	-Wraps code that might cause an exception.
	-If an exception occurs inside the try block, the program immediately jumps to the matching catch block.

ii.catch block:
	-Handles the exception that occurs in the try block.
	-Prevents the program from crashing.

iii.finally Block - Always executes â€” even if an exception occurs or not. Good for cleaning up resources.

iv.throw Keyword - Used to manually throw an exception.

v.throws Keyword - Used to declare exceptions a method might throw.
