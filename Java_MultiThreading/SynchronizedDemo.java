/*
The synchronized keyword in Java is used to control access to critical sections of code when multiple threads are involved.
It ensures that only one thread at a time can access the synchronized block or method 
â€” preventing race conditions and data inconsistency.

Why we use Synchronized?
	When multiple threads access shared data, they can cause unexpected behavior if not controlled.
	synchronized helps in ensuring thread safety.

| Feature         | Description                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `synchronized`  | Prevents simultaneous access by multiple threads |
| Use with method | Locks the entire method                          |
| Use with block  | Locks only critical section                      |
| Lock object     | Every object has an internal lock (monitor)      |
| Problem solved  | Race conditions, inconsistent data               |
